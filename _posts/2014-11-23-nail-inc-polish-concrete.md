I popped into Tk Maxx earlier looking for a red nail polish. Originally I fancied an OPI but they only had glitter varnishes and we all know they are a pain to remove!

Luckily I found this one by Nails Inc:

It came out in 2013 and is being sold for £5 on their website but it was still cheaper at good ol' TK Maxx for £3.99.

It's a textured nail polish, which I didn't realise until I applied it. You would think the lid would have given it away... because the lid is all bumpy. I thought it would be all gritty but it's not rough, it feels like little dots and it won't scratch you.

Rating: it's a nice tomato red but I prefer having smooth Matt or glossy nails.
4/5
