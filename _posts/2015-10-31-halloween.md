Halloween is finally here! For me this is an exciting time, being the day before my Birthday!! :) So what better time to relax and watch something spooky whilst snuggling under a blanket and possibly hiding behind a cushion at times.

Some of my favourite spooky shows and films:

<strong>Hocus Pocus</strong>

A must! Three witches get resurrected on All Hallows Eve and try to kill all of the kids in town, well its a Disney film so its more 'I want their soul' and less 'I want their blood.' This film was released in 1993, so its over 20 years old now! But it's still a cult classic and hilarious movie for all the family to watch. The talking cat is my favourite character - meow.

<strong>Scream - </strong>A proper slasher movie from the 90s.The ghost face mask freaks me out on it's own, even before the grizzly murders and creepy phone calls: "Whats your favourite scary movie?"

<strong>American Horror Story-</strong> Which series to pick! Each season the same actors play different characters in a story based round a creepy theme. It's got a pretty good cast from Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates and Evan Peters to name a few. All of the series might be linked :) which is exciting.

<em>Murder House</em> - The first series, I'd say the most tame of all the seasons so far, but it's still very disturbing! Evil ghosts that torment the new family that have moved in; needless to say it doesn't end well.

<em>Asylum&nbsp;</em>- Set in a mental institution in the 60s. There are Nazi's, alien abductions and amputations; all very messed up as you can imagine.

<em>Coven - </em>Based on this witchcraft academy in south America, where they try to train young witches. All of the witches have their own power and only one can be the supreme. There's voodoo, witchcraft, a zombie and a racist serial killer. Twisted enough?

<i>Freak Show</i>- I haven't completely finished this season yet. It's based on a freak show where you learn about the characters disabilities and yet serial killers both dead and alive are roaming around the tent. The clown in the show is the scariest thing I've ever seen, so it's far too scary to post a picture of him!&nbsp;

<i>Hotel</i> - Is now out, so each week I'm hooked to a new, even more&nbsp;twisted episode. So far there are vampires and creatures that have been stitched up into mattresses and other horrors I can't even begin to write down in words.&nbsp;

<strong>Nightmare before Christmas - </strong>The tale of Jack and Sally. Not sure if this is more of a Christmas movie or not, but it's one of my favourite films of all time. A great Tim Burton classic, my favourite character is Oogie Boogie, this sack full of insects.

<strong>Casper</strong> - Casper the friendly ghost, the friendliest ghost you know! A young girl moves to a new town with her Dad. The house they live in turns out to be haunted by ghosts, 3 of the goods are annoying, except for Casper who takes a shine to the female lead.&nbsp;

Casper is a beautifully made movie. It has great humor, excellent cast, an enchanting music score, spectacular special effects and a very touching story. Look out for some cool cameos (including Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson).

<strong>Sleepy Hollow</strong>

The headless horsemen. A tree full of bloody heads! Need I say more? Another awesome Tim Burton film.
