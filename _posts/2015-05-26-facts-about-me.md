1) I highlight text as I'm reading it or underline it all

2) I read trashy magazines such as Heat magazine or even Love It! I'm ashamed to admit it but it's what I do.

3) My second toe is larger than my big toe- does this mean I'm an alien?

4) I really have to push myself to exercise but I enjoy dancing/ yoga and Zumba when I can motivate myself that is!

5) I love living by the sea- the sea air, seagulls, arcades, beach and ice-cream to name a few! <a href="http://chantymarie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_2798.jpg"><img class=" aligncenter" src="http://chantymarie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_2798.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="551" /></a>

6) Never been a big fan of breakfast, I used to eat oranges or ice-cream!

7) Which reminds me, I've always been a big fan of ice-cream but we've had a love hate relationship since I ate too much and felt sick.

8) I can be as stubborn as a bull sometimes.

9) I'm always playing with my hair, I think it's a nervous habit.

10) I suffer from anxiety, I over analyse things and let it get too much sometimes (ok a lot!)

11) I have a degree in Psychology, which although I won't use it directly with my career I've learnt so much about people's behaviour and what makes people tick that I like to think I have a better understanding of people. Just maybe!

12) I cannot walk past a Lush or Disney store haven't rushing in, I try to avoid purchasing smellies and toys.

13) I'm lazy when it comes to makeup and hair.

14) I had red hair for years and loved it but then decided to go blonde- you can imagine what happened!

15) When I'm being sarcastic (fairly often) my tone of voice doesn't change so it confuses people, I bamboozle them!

16) I love most animals, love caring for things that can't talk. It's a bonus if they are cute &gt;.&lt;

17) I want a pet pug! Soooo badly.

18) Pamper days and little treats. Live life to the full because we only live once.. probably.

19) I'm easily marketable. Advertise something well and I'll be dying to buy it.

20) I'm a bit of a book worm- got my own library going on.

21) I loveeee music and even had my own radio show show at university.

22) I'm a bit of a singer but mainly in the shower because I'm not 100% happy about my voice.
