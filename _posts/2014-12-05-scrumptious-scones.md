After watching the Great British Bake Off, I decided to try and make some scones. I'm not a huge fan of cream but after adding some thick clotted cream, I was hooked! I used a Delia recipe for these creations. The mix should be enough for at least 12 scones.

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>40g butter (I used unsalted)</li>
	<li>225g self-raising flour</li>
	<li>100ml milk (semi-skimmed)</li>
	<li>1 1/2 tbp of golden caster sugar</li>
	<li>Pinch of salt</li>
	<li>A little bit of extra flour for dusting</li>
</ul>
<strong>Method</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Turn the oven on to 220c/200 fan</li>
	<li>Begin by rubbing the butter into the sieved flour quickly, using your fingertips,then stir in the sugar followed by a pinch of salt.</li>
	<li>Now, using a knife, mix in the milk little by little, and when it’s all in, flour your hands and knead the mixture to a soft dough (you may need just a drop more milk if it feels dry).</li>
	<li>Place the dough on a floured pastry board and with a rolling pin (also floured) lightly roll it out to a thickness of about 3cm. (This thickness is vital. The reason scones don’t rise enough is because they are rolled too thin.)</li>
	<li>Then take the pastry cutter and tap it sharply so that it goes straight through the dough – do not twist or the scones will turn out a strange shape!</li>
	<li>When you have cut as many as you can, knead the remaining dough together again and repeat. Then place the scones on the baking sheet, dust each one with flour and bake near the top of the oven for 12–15 minutes.</li>
	<li>When they’re done they will have risen and turned a golden brown.</li>
	<li>Then transfer them to a wire rack and eat as soon as they are cool enough, spread with butter, jam and clotted cream.</li>
</ol>

You can see how the turned out above. Some of them were a tad over cooked, I guess it takes experience to known how long to cook them for. I glazed them nicely so you can see a shine on top. I tried making unusual shaped scones, they are meant to be hearts and flowers.

Overall they are a delicious treat for an afternoon tea :D enjoy!
