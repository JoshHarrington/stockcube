With Christmas coming up in 5 weeks, I decided to get into the spirit, and attempted to ice skate last weekend.
I chose the Natural History Museum (mainly because I found a deal for 2 for Â£15)

View of the History museum and the carousel:

Getting our skates on, we waddled to the beautiful ice rink. Considering I hadn't skated in about a decade (God help me!) I was rather apprehensive of skating. You can rent a skating penguin to help you glide along, but I think those were just for the kids. <!--more-->
I was tempted though. Before we went onto the rink I heard someone say 'the tighter the skates are the better you are at skating' having tested this theory I don't think that's the case! You really need to be able to bend your knees and glide.

The area around the rink was light up and the trees had lights wrapped around them, it was beautiful.

Braving the rink for the first time in ages, I begin to slide and grip against the sides. Praise da lord there was a baby section so I could learn :-) I gripped hold of my boyfriend most of the time, but I gradually got the gist of it.

I'm not natural at skating but the whole experience was lovely and would probably be more enjoyable if you can skate!

Once our 50 mins were up, we traded our skates in and went upstairs to the bar, where we had some mulled wine and mince pies. It was a great opportunity to get into the Christmas feel :) there was also a balcony where you can watch people skate around the massive Christmas tree in the middle of the rink.

Pure Christmas joy for skaters or drinkers (who just go to the bar)
