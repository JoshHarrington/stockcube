There's this hugely popular show, Game of Thrones which you must have heard of, it's got a huge following. Season 5 premieres on April 8th, so not long now people!

It's based on the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros (a fictional world) which is ruled by the Great Houses such as House Lannister or House Stark but the ultimate power derives from the King on the Iron Throne. It's complicated to explain but basically everyone wants to be on the throne! To dictate and rule, so as you can imagine no rules apply, nobody is safe!

I also watch it for this guy:

It is one of the best shows I've watched in years but beware, theres no point loving any of the characters because none of them are safe from death! Take the Red Wedding for example... anyway trying not to spill any major spoilers...I was very excited to be invited to the Game of Thrones Exhibit and the tickets were free with Sky :) bonus!

Before you go to the event you are asked to pledge allegiance to a House. It says 'Your house is your family, and its banner, your badge of distinction. Choose wisely and serve loyally.'

You only get the option of choosing between House Baratheon, Lannister, Stark and Targaryen.

After thinking for a few moments about the members of each house I was torn between Stark and Targaryen but settled for House Targaryen because of these babies:

The dragons! I fancy myself as The Mother of Dragons.

When you register with a House you are emailed a code which you need when you take part in the interactive experiences.

When I turned up at the O2 there was a merchandise shop next door, so I treated myself to a T-Shirt:

When we walked through the doors we were told you can only walk in one direction, you can't go back so we made sure we took photos of everything! There were lots of costumes from the actors and the lady who worked at the exhibition told us they weren't washed :O

There were also lots of props from the show as well:

I had to have my photo taken with the Mountain Sword:

There were four fun opportunities. The first you could be filmed being burnt by one of the dragons! The second was you could be turned into a White Walker and have your photos taken.

Then the experience we queued for over AN HOUR for.. you get to experience walking along The Wall. You go into a cubicle with a VR headset and it feels like you are in the Game of Thrones world. I really felt like I was there! It was a shame it only lasted for about 2 minutes!

Then finally you can have your picture taken on the Throne! 

It's a pretty good way to spend a couple of hours, especially cos I'm a hardcore fan of the show! It was enjoyable seeing some of the props and costumes, you begin to realise all the work that goes into the show which is impressive.

So if they do an exhibition next year try and go :) especially if you're a big fan of the show.
